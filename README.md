# C# 2D Platformenr
A project scoring 100% for its documentation, testing and functionality.

## Description

I created this as my project for my Computer Science A level NEA. I chose to make a 2D platformer to delve into a new area. I thought it would be a fun and exciting project which my friends and I could enjoy. I used the plaform Unity to create it, alongside Visual Studio. I created a UI for menu options and the game is played with general game controls (arrows and spacebar).
